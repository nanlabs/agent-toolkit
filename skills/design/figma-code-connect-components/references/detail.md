## Examples

### Example 1: Connecting a Button Component

User says: "Connect this Figma button to my code: https://figma.com/design/kL9xQn2VwM8pYrTb4ZcHjF/DesignSystem?node-id=42-15"

**Actions:**

1. Parse URL: fileKey=`kL9xQn2VwM8pYrTb4ZcHjF`, nodeId=`42-15` → convert to `42:15`
2. Run `get_code_connect_suggestions(fileKey="kL9xQn2VwM8pYrTb4ZcHjF", nodeId="42:15")`
3. Response shows: Button component (unmapped) with `variant` (primary/secondary) and `size` (sm/md/lg) properties, plus a thumbnail image
4. Search codebase for Button components: Find `src/components/Button.tsx`
5. Read `Button.tsx` and confirm it has `variant` and `size` props
6. Present to user:
   ```
   I found a match:
   - [Button](src/components/Button.tsx): Button at nodeId [42:15](https://figma.com/design/kL9xQn2VwM8pYrTb4ZcHjF/DesignSystem?node-id=42-15)

   Would you like to connect this component?
   ```

7. User confirms: "Yes"
8. Detect that it's a TypeScript React component
9. Run `send_code_connect_mappings(fileKey="kL9xQn2VwM8pYrTb4ZcHjF", nodeId="42:15", mappings=[{ nodeId: "42:15", componentName: "Button", source: "src/components/Button.tsx", label: "React" }])`

**Result:** Figma button component is now connected to the code Button component.

### Example 2: Multiple Components with Partial Selection

User says: "Connect components in this frame: https://figma.com/design/pR8mNv5KqXzGwY2JtCfL4D/Components?node-id=10-50"

**Actions:**

1. Parse URL: fileKey=`pR8mNv5KqXzGwY2JtCfL4D`, nodeId=`10-50` → convert to `10:50`
2. Run `get_code_connect_suggestions(fileKey="pR8mNv5KqXzGwY2JtCfL4D", nodeId="10:50")`
3. Response shows 3 unmapped components: ProductCard, Badge, and CustomWidget
4. Search codebase:
   - ProductCard: Found `src/components/ProductCard.tsx` (props match)
   - Badge: Found `src/components/Badge.tsx` (props match)
   - CustomWidget: No matching component found
5. Present to user:
   ```
   The following components match the design:
   - [ProductCard](src/components/ProductCard.tsx): ProductCard at nodeId [10:51](https://figma.com/design/pR8mNv5KqXzGwY2JtCfL4D/Components?node-id=10-51)
   - [Badge](src/components/Badge.tsx): Badge at nodeId [10:52](https://figma.com/design/pR8mNv5KqXzGwY2JtCfL4D/Components?node-id=10-52)

   I couldn't find a match for CustomWidget (10:53).

   Would you like to connect these components? You can accept all, select specific ones, or skip.
   ```

6. User: "Just connect ProductCard, skip Badge for now"
7. Run `send_code_connect_mappings(fileKey="pR8mNv5KqXzGwY2JtCfL4D", nodeId="10:50", mappings=[{ nodeId: "10:51", componentName: "ProductCard", source: "src/components/ProductCard.tsx", label: "React" }])`

**Result:** Only ProductCard is connected, per the user's selection.

### Example 3: Component Needs Creation

User says: "Connect this icon: https://figma.com/design/8yJDMeWDyBz71EnMOSuUiw/Icons?node-id=5-20"

**Actions:**

1. Parse URL: fileKey=`8yJDMeWDyBz71EnMOSuUiw`, nodeId=`5-20` → convert to `5:20`
2. Run `get_code_connect_suggestions(fileKey="8yJDMeWDyBz71EnMOSuUiw", nodeId="5:20")`
3. Response shows: CheckIcon component (unmapped) with color and size properties
4. Search codebase for CheckIcon: No matches found
5. Search for generic Icon components: Find `src/icons/` directory with other icons
6. Report to user: "I couldn't find a CheckIcon component, but I found an icons directory at src/icons/. Would you like to:
   - Create a new CheckIcon.tsx component first, then connect it
   - Connect to a different existing icon
   - Provide the path to the CheckIcon if it exists elsewhere"
7. User provides path: "src/icons/CheckIcon.tsx"
8. Detect language and framework from the file
9. Run `send_code_connect_mappings(fileKey="8yJDMeWDyBz71EnMOSuUiw", nodeId="5:20", mappings=[{ nodeId: "5:20", componentName: "CheckIcon", source: "src/icons/CheckIcon.tsx", label: "React" }])`

**Result:** CheckIcon component is successfully connected to the Figma design.

## Best Practices

### Proactive Component Discovery

Don't just ask the user for the file path — actively search their codebase to find matching components. This provides a better experience and catches potential mapping opportunities.

### Accurate Structure Matching

When comparing Figma components to code components, look beyond just names. Check that:

- Props align (variant types, size options, etc.)
- Component hierarchy matches (nested elements)
- The component serves the same purpose

### Clear Communication

When offering to create a mapping, clearly explain:

- What you found
- Why it's a good match
- What the mapping will do
- How props will be connected

### Handle Ambiguity

If multiple components could match, present options rather than guessing. Let the user make the final decision about which component to connect.

### Graceful Degradation

If you can't find an exact match, provide helpful next steps:

- Show close candidates
- Suggest component creation
- Ask for user guidance

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "No published components found in this selection"

**Cause:** The Figma component is not published to a team library. Code Connect only works with published components.
**Solution:** The user needs to publish the component to a team library in Figma:

1. In Figma, select the component or component set
2. Right-click and choose "Publish to library" or use the Team Library publish modal
3. Publish the component
4. Once published, retry the Code Connect mapping with the same node ID

### Issue: "Code Connect is only available on Organization and Enterprise plans"

**Cause:** The user's Figma plan does not include Code Connect access.
**Solution:** The user needs to upgrade to an Organization or Enterprise plan, or contact their administrator.

### Issue: No matching component found in codebase

**Cause:** The codebase search did not find a component with a matching name or structure.
**Solution:** Ask the user if the component exists under a different name or in a different location. They may need to create the component first, or it might be located in an unexpected directory.

### Issue: "Published component not found" (CODE_CONNECT_ASSET_NOT_FOUND)

**Cause:** The source file path is incorrect, the component doesn't exist at that location, or the componentName doesn't match the actual export.
**Solution:** Verify the source path is correct and relative to the project root. Check that the component is properly exported from the file with the exact componentName specified.

### Issue: "Component is already mapped to code" (CODE_CONNECT_MAPPING_ALREADY_EXISTS)

**Cause:** A Code Connect mapping already exists for this component.
**Solution:** The component is already connected. If the user wants to update the mapping, they may need to remove the existing one first in Figma.

### Issue: "Insufficient permissions to create mapping" (CODE_CONNECT_INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS)

**Cause:** The user does not have edit permissions on the Figma file or library.
**Solution:** The user needs edit access to the file containing the component. Contact the file owner or team admin.

### Issue: Code Connect mapping fails with URL errors

**Cause:** The Figma URL format is incorrect or missing the `node-id` parameter.
**Solution:** Verify the URL follows the required format: `https://figma.com/design/:fileKey/:fileName?node-id=1-2`. The `node-id` parameter is required. Also ensure you convert `1-2` to `1:2` when calling tools.

### Issue: Multiple similar components found

**Cause:** The codebase contains multiple components that could match the Figma component.
**Solution:** Present all candidates to the user with their file paths and let them choose which one to connect. Different components might be used in different contexts (e.g., `Button.tsx` vs `LinkButton.tsx`).

## Understanding Code Connect

Code Connect establishes a bidirectional link between design and code:

**For designers:** See which code component implements a Figma component
**For developers:** Navigate from Figma designs directly to the code that implements them
**For teams:** Maintain a single source of truth for component mappings

The mapping you create helps keep design and code in sync by making these connections explicit and discoverable.
