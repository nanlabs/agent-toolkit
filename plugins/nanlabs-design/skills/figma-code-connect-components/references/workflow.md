## Required Workflow

**Follow these steps in order. Do not skip steps.**

### Step 1: Get Code Connect Suggestions

Call `get_code_connect_suggestions` to identify all unmapped components in a single operation. This tool automatically:

- Fetches component info from the Figma scenegraph
- Identifies published components in the selection
- Checks existing Code Connect mappings and filters out already-connected components
- Returns component names, properties, and thumbnail images for each unmapped component

#### Option A: Using `figma-desktop` MCP (no URL provided)

If the `figma-desktop` MCP server is connected and the user has NOT provided a Figma URL, immediately call `get_code_connect_suggestions`. No URL parsing is needed — the desktop MCP server automatically uses the currently selected node from the open Figma file.

**Note:** The user must have the Figma desktop app open with a node selected. `fileKey` is not passed as a parameter — the server uses the currently open file.

#### Option B: When a Figma URL is provided

Parse the URL to extract `fileKey` and `nodeId`, then call `get_code_connect_suggestions`.

**IMPORTANT:** When extracting the node ID from a Figma URL, convert the format:

- URL format uses hyphens: `node-id=1-2`
- Tool expects colons: `nodeId=1:2`

**Parse the Figma URL:**

- URL format: `https://figma.com/design/:fileKey/:fileName?node-id=1-2`
- Extract file key: `:fileKey` (segment after `/design/`)
- Extract node ID: `1-2` from URL, then convert to `1:2` for the tool

```
get_code_connect_suggestions(fileKey=":fileKey", nodeId="1:2")
```

**Handle the response:**

- If the tool returns **"No published components found in this selection"** → inform the user and stop. The components may need to be published to a team library first.
- If the tool returns **"All component instances in this selection are already connected to code via Code Connect"** → inform the user that everything is already mapped.
- Otherwise, the response contains a list of unmapped components, each with:
  - Component name
  - Node ID
  - Component properties (JSON with prop names and values)
  - A thumbnail image of the component (for visual inspection)

### Step 2: Scan Codebase for Matching Components

For each unmapped component returned by `get_code_connect_suggestions`, search the codebase for a matching code component.

**What to look for:**

- Component names that match or are similar to the Figma component name
- Component structure that aligns with the Figma hierarchy
- Props that correspond to Figma properties (variants, text, styles)
- Files in typical component directories (`src/components/`, `components/`, `ui/`, etc.)

**Search strategy:**

1. Search for component files with matching names
2. Read candidate files to check structure and props
3. Compare the code component's props with the Figma component properties returned in Step 1
4. Detect the programming language (TypeScript, JavaScript) and framework (React, Vue, etc.)
5. Identify the best match based on structural similarity, weighing:
   - Prop names and their correspondence to Figma properties
   - Default values that match Figma defaults
   - CSS classes or style objects
   - Descriptive comments that clarify intent
6. If multiple candidates are equally good, pick the one with the closest prop-interface match and document your reasoning in a 1-2 sentence comment before your tool call

**Example search patterns:**

- If Figma component is "PrimaryButton", search for `Button.tsx`, `PrimaryButton.tsx`, `Button.jsx`
- Check common component paths: `src/components/`, `app/components/`, `lib/ui/`
- Look for variant props like `variant`, `size`, `color` that match Figma variants

### Step 3: Present Matches to User

Present your findings and let the user choose which mappings to create. The user can accept all, some, or none of the suggested mappings.

**Present matches in this format:**

```
The following components match the design:
- [ComponentName](path/to/component): DesignComponentName at nodeId [nodeId](figmaUrl?node-id=X-Y)
- [AnotherComponent](path/to/another): AnotherDesign at nodeId [nodeId2](figmaUrl?node-id=X-Y)

Would you like to connect these components? You can accept all, select specific ones, or skip.
```

**If no exact match is found for a component:**

- Show the 2 closest candidates
- Explain the differences
- Ask the user to confirm which component to use or provide the correct path

**If the user declines all mappings**, inform them and stop. No further tool calls are needed.

### Step 4: Create Code Connect Mappings

Once the user confirms their selections, call `send_code_connect_mappings` with only the accepted mappings. This tool handles batch creation of all mappings in a single call.

**Example:**

```
send_code_connect_mappings(
  fileKey=":fileKey",
  nodeId="1:2",
  mappings=[
    { nodeId: "1:2", componentName: "Button", source: "src/components/Button.tsx", label: "React" },
    { nodeId: "1:5", componentName: "Card", source: "src/components/Card.tsx", label: "React" }
  ]
)
```

**Key parameters for each mapping:**

- `nodeId`: The Figma node ID (with colon format: `1:2`)
- `componentName`: Name of the component to connect (e.g., "Button", "Card")
- `source`: Path to the code component file (relative to project root)
- `label`: The framework or language label for this Code Connect mapping. Valid values include:
  - Web: 'React', 'Web Components', 'Vue', 'Svelte', 'Storybook', 'Javascript'
  - iOS: 'Swift UIKit', 'Objective-C UIKit', 'SwiftUI'
  - Android: 'Compose', 'Java', 'Kotlin', 'Android XML Layout'
  - Cross-platform: 'Flutter'
  - Docs: 'Markdown'

**After the call:**

- On success: the tool confirms the mappings were created
- On error: the tool reports which specific mappings failed and why (e.g., "Component is already mapped to code", "Published component not found", "Insufficient permissions")

**Provide a summary** after processing:

```
Code Connect Summary:
- Successfully connected: 3
  - Button (1:2) → src/components/Button.tsx
  - Card (1:5) → src/components/Card.tsx
  - Input (1:8) → src/components/Input.tsx
- Could not connect: 1
  - CustomWidget (1:10) - No matching component found in codebase
```
